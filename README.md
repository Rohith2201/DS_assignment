# ZeoTap_DS_assignment
# eCommerce Transactions Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the solution to the eCommerce Transactions Dataset assignment, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques.

## Assignment Overview

The dataset consists of three files:
1. `Customers.csv` - Customer information
2. `Products.csv` - Product details
3. `Transactions.csv` - Transaction records

The task involves:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform analysis and derive business insights.
2. **Lookalike Model:** Build a model that recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
3. **Customer Segmentation/Clustering:** Use clustering techniques to segment customers and evaluate clusters using DB Index.

## Files

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- `J VENKATA LAKSHMI SAI ROHITH_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code.
- `J VENKATA LAKSHMI SAI ROHITH_EDA.pdf`: PDF report summarizing the business insights derived from the EDA.

### 2. Lookalike Model

- `J VENKATA LAKSHMI SAI ROHITH_Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook explaining the development of the Lookalike Model.
- `J VENKATA LAKSHMI SAI ROHITH_Lookalike.csv`: CSV file with the top 3 lookalike customers for the first 20 customers, along with their similarity scores.

### 3. Customer Segmentation/Clustering

- `J VENKATA LAKSHMI SAI ROHITH_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the clustering code and analysis.
- `J VENKATA LAKSHMI SAI ROHITH_Clustering.pdf`: PDF report summarizing the clustering results, including DB Index and other relevant metrics.
